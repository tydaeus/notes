# SOAP in ServiceNow

* Page fragments can be viewed via requests like `table_name_list.do` for their standard html rendering
* Can go to `table_name_list.do?WSDL` to view the WSDL for accessing the relevant data
    - the WSDL provides a definition of the requests that can be sent and the structure for their responses
* `table_name_list.do?JSONv2` can be used to view the contents of the list in JSON format
