	1. Open SVN Repository Perspective
	2. Right click in the desired location and select new -> new remote folder
	3. Create the new folder
	4. Right click the original branch(/trunk) and select Branch/Tag...
	5. Specify the URL for the new folder (you may want to copy-paste this somewhere for safekeeping; browse is slow)
	6. Click ok

To switch to a different branch:
	1. create the new branch if necessary
	2. return to normal project view (Web/Java EE etc)
	3. in project/enterprise explorer, right click on the folder you want to switch branches, select Team -> 
	   Switch to Another Branch/Tag

To update your current branch to reflect changes to the trunk (or other branch):
	1. right click your branch
	2. select team -> merge
	3. under "from" branch specify the current branch; select head unless a different revision is required
	4. under "to" specify the branch being merged with; select head unless a different revision is required
	5. After merging, click "Synchronize with Repository" to manually resolve any issues (there will be issues)
		- the current branch's version of files will be displayed as the repository version
		- the results of the merge will be displayed as the current version
		- use revert (sometimes will need to choose twice) to undo changes made by the merge, or manually select which
		  to remove and which to keep.
	6. Commit to save the changes or revert to return to the version of your branch that's in the repository
	
To merge current branch to trunk
	1. update current branch to reflect trunk changes (as above)
	2. then, update the trunk to reflect the branch (as above)
