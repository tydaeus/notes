# Getting Started with Bower

## Installation
Bower requires node, npm, and git.
Install bower with npm:
```sh
npm install -g bower
```

## Project Setup
Use `bower init` to create a bower.json file. This file stores the list of dependencies in your project.

## Installing Packages

```sh
bower install PACKAGE
```
The `--save` flag will add the installed package to the bower.json file.
