# Simplicity Manifesto

Excerpt from InfoQ article [Simplicity, Please - A Manifesto for Software Development](https://www.infoq.com/articles/simplicity-manifesto-development). Emphasis mine.

This is a manifesto for better software development, or more modestly, a plea for common sense. If your organization isn't yet past the breaking point, follow the prescription below. It's a road map to unwind the complexity of your software, achieving along the way markedly lower development costs, faster time to market, and a sustainable development process that secures the future of your company while leaving competitors in your wake.

**Learn**. Complexity can only be fixed from the top down. Leaders need to invest time to understand everything that happens along the software development production line. How much time? You'll know you've accomplished your goal when time-to-market is a consideration secondary to the simplicity of your code.

**Lead**. Instill an emphasis on simplicity through the ranks of engineering management so your organization is aligned around a new set of values. Communicate the strategic value of this initiative.

**Reevaluate**. Assess whether workflow management methodologies such as Agile really better fit your needs than alternative approaches that emphasize design quality over implementation speed.

**Hire strategically**. Recruit developers who love simplicity. These are people who'll typically be among the slowest to write actual code, favoring instead lengthy periods of time to analyze requirements and architect optimal solutions in terms of the code’s maintainability, execution time, memory consumption, and data storage. They’ll also take pride in documenting their work and sharing knowledge with peers.

**Manage knowledge**. Knowledge of your code is the lifeblood of your company, and that knowledge needs to diffuse throughout the organization rather than reside in localized silos. Maintaining a diffuse knowledge structure means investing more time in knowledge sharing, but will allow you to quickly redeploy engineers according to the changing needs of the business.

**Keep your eyes on the road**. A beguiling and ever-growing array of technologies and tools now exists for writing, testing, deploying, and monitoring software. Most are largely duplicative, conferring only incremental benefits and high switching costs. Make smart choices on a small subset of these offerings. Give primary consideration to the technologies your engineers already know.
