# Clean Language
Notes from InfoQ article [Coaching with Curiosity Using Clean Language and Agile](https://www.infoq.com/articles/coaching-clean-language-agile).

Using clean language can help get to the root of a problem, by avoiding imposing observational bias.

## Clean Questions
These questions work as clean language for clarifying what someone has said, using their own language to avoid observational bias. Replace the ellipsis (...) with an excerpt from the other person's speaking. Don't worry about grammatical correctness. Don't respond conversationally, avoid your own biases and preconceptions.

### Example Clean Questions

* What kind of...?
* Is there anything else about...?
* Where is...?
* When ..., then what happens?
* What happens just before ...?
* Is there a relationship between ... and ... ?
* When ..., what happens to ...?

### Example Customer Coaching Questions
After customer talks, ask:

* What would you like to have happen?
* What needs to happen for (last answer)?
* Can (last answer) happen/be done?
* And when (last answer), then what happens?

Use other clean questions for clarification.


## Clean Feedback
Separate feedback into 3 parts to prevent an antagonistic interaction.

1. Observation
    - not an evaluation, but an objective recounting of what was seen or heard
    - e.g. "I noticed you did..."
2. Inference
    - add in observer's interpretation of what was done, clearly phrased as their interpretation
    - e.g. "I took this to mean you intended to..."
3. Impact
    - state why the observed behavior mattered to the feedback giver
    - e.g. "As a result, I felt..."
