# Viewing History in Git

## `git log`

### Viewing Commit Log

Use `git log` to view the history of commits with their time, user id, hash, and commit message.

#### Viewing Commit Details

Use `git log -p` to show the changes made in each commit in addition to the `git log` details.

Use `git log -p --follow FILENAME` to restrict the detailed logs to a specific file.
