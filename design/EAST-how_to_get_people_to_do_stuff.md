# EAST - How to get People to do Stuff
From [The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/26/nudge_theory_devops/).

Using Nudge Theory, you can encourage developers (or others) to adopt new practices and tools by following EAST - Easy, Attractive, Social, Timely.

## Easy
Make it easy for people to do what you want them to do. Easy to understand the benefits, and easy to take the appropriate action. Use clear, simple messages with a good choice of defaults.

## Attractive
People are more likely to do something their attention is drawn towards. Avoid noise and overwhelming message flows.

1. Attract people's attention so they know what you're asking for
2. Explain why they should want to do it

## Social
Foster collaborative behaviors, prevent silos. Encourage conversation, sharing, and inter-project communication.

## Timely
Give people what they need when they need it. Pay attention to when things are introduced during the workcycle.
